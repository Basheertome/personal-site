	<h2>Google Glass</h2>
	<h3>Interaction Research</h3>
	<p>While working as an interaction researcher on Glass, my job was to play with experimental hardware and software input technologies, in order to come up with new user-centric application concepts for them. I then used a range of design and prototyping methods to inspire and rally people around these ideas.</p><p>During my time there, I worked closely with industrial designers, engineers, user-experience designers, and high-level managers to help affect the strategic planning and future development of the product.</p>
